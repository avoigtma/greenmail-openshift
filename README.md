# greenmail-openshift

Build and deploy [GreenMail][greenmail_project_site] on OpenShift.

From the [GreenMail][greenmail_project_site] ReadMe:

> GreenMail allows developers to test email-based applications, services or systems without access to a live mail server.
Developers can send, receive, and verify emails by embedding GreenMail in a unit test or running it as a standalone container.
GreenMail acts as a virtual (mocking/sandbox) mail server and supports common mail protocols SMTP, IMAP and POP3.
